/**
 * Main `@Trace()` decorator for class methods to be traced. Due to typescript decorator
 * restrictions, we cannot apply this decorator to normal functions :/
 * So, every traced function must be a class method.
 *
 * THERE IS JUST ONE SIMPLE RULE TO USE `@Trace()` DECORATOR:
 * All the `Trace()`d methods must take an `opentracing.Span` instance as first parameter.
 * Type definition for this rule is already set, so it shouldn't be a problem.
 *
 * Sample usage:
 * ```ts
 * class Calculator {
 *      @Trace({ operationName: 'multiply', relationType: 'newTrace', autoFinish: true })
 *      multiply(span, a, b) {
 *          // `span` is automatically created from opentracing's global tracer
 *          // with it's operation name set, you can use standart `opentracing.Span` methods.
 *          span.addTags({ a, b });
 *
 *          let acc = 0;
 *          for (let i = 0; i < b; i++) {
 *              acc = this.sum(span, acc, a); // Call with current span
 *          }
 *
 *          return acc;
 *      }
 *
 *
 *      @Trace({ relationType: 'childOf', autoFinish: true }) // operationName can be omitted, method name is used by default
 *      sum(span, a, b) {
 *          span.logger.info(`Sum is called with ${a} and ${b}`);
 *          return a + b;
 *      }
 * }
 *
 * const calculator = new Calculator();
 * calculator.multiply(null, 4, 6); // There is no span passed!
 * // Because `multiply` method's trace relation is set to `newTrace`
 * ```
 *
 *
 * If `autoFinish` is set true, return value of the method will be checked. If it is promise-like
 * object, we will wait until it settles. If it's resolved, current span will be finished normally. If it's
 * rejected, current span's `error` tag will be set true and an error log will be added automatically, then
 * it will finish current span.
 *
 * If it returns not promise, we assume it's a sync method and will finish automatically.
 * So, if your method is async with callback-style control flow, you must set `autoFinish` to `false`,
 * and call `span.finish()` manually.
 *
 * If `autoFinish` is set false, return value of the method is not checked, it will be return immediately.
 * Therefore it's implementor's responsibility to call `span.finish()` to finish current span.
 * Sample usage:
 * ```ts
 * @Trace({ relationType: 'childOf', autoFinish: false })
 * getSomethingFromDatabase(span, id) {
 *      // ...
 *      db.get(id, (err, result) => {
 *          if (err) {
 *              span.setTag('error', true);
 *              span.logger.error('Something went wrong', err);
 *          }
 *
 *          span.finish();
 *      });
 * }
 * ```
