/**
 * Converts spans into zipkin-compatible json format and reports to
 * Zipkin's json-v2 http endpoints. Please refer:
 * https://zipkin.apache.org/zipkin-api/#/default/post_spans
 *
 * Also works with Jaeger collector's partial implementation of Zipkinâ€™s
 * HTTP POST endpoint when `COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT=9411` is set.
 *
 * Since Zipkin API allows CORS, this reporter works on both browser and node.
 * Jaeger's partial Zipkin implementation also has CORS settings, I guess:
 * https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1463
 *
 * For http communication `fetch()` API is used. In you're in browser, no worries,
 * just pass built-in `window.fetch.bind(window)`. You need to bind call context to window object
 * to prevent `TypeError: Failed to execute 'fetch' on 'Window': Illegal invocation` error.
 * If you're in node.js, you need to bring your own fetch, check `node-fetch` package.
